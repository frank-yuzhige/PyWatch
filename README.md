# PyWatch

This is a demo version of `ALXWatch`,
a [React Recoil](https://recoiljs.org/) style state-management framework that carries out minimal incremental computation. Its enhanced version is used in Arctic Lake's core trading service for state-monitoring, asynchronous event handling and testing.
